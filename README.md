For this project to run properly, it is necessary to download all of the files, apart from the pictures, from this github and have them in the same directory.

After that is done, compile the JWKS.py file in a compiler with python downloaded by doing python ./JWKS.py

Once the JWKS server is running, in a different terminal, execute the gradebot by doing gradebot.exe project2.

After these steps are completed, you should see the table presented from teh gradebot.
